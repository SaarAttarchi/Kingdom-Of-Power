# Kingdom Of Power
Kingdom Of Power is a 3D adventure game developed in Unity by Saar Attarchi.
This game was developed as a single player visual quest experience that lets the player emerge in a fantasy world.
The quest includes wondering in several environments such as: Forst lands, Medieval city, Mysterious cave and more.
The player's main goal is to defeat an evil monster that hunts the land with special weapons the player finds along the way.
The game was developed with a robust persistence system ensures seamless data saving and restoration between different scenes, allowing players to manage resources like health, gold, and weapon upgrades effectively.
My objective for this game was to engage players with immersive gameplay mechanics and dynamic storytelling.
